# ISS-Overhead-Notifier
Sends you a mail whenever the ISS is directly overhead you and its night time so you can see it.
Just change your latitude and longitude from the default New York ones.
Change your email and password from the fake ones I added.(Works for gmail, could work for other mails too but I need to change it up just a bit)
Enable the app restrictions in your gmail account and run it so that Gmail lets it access the account.
